“Mexican” Guacamole
- 2 ripe avocados
- ½ pressed lime
- 1 tomato
- 1 tablespoon of soy sauce (salt)
- Fresh coriander (to taste)
- Garlic (to taste)

Remove the avocados from their peels. Cut the avocados into small pieces
and squeeze them finely with a fork in a bowl. Chop the tomato and
coriander into small pieces. Mix the soy sauce, tomato, and coriander
through the avocados. Squeeze half a lime and add to the mixture.
Tip: Add the core of the avocados to the guacamole to prevent it from
getting brown
